The sexual and reproductive health of Americans, young and old, remains an issue; looking at HIV and STI infection rates highlights the problem, not to mention the complexities of accessing birth control and critical reproductive health services. Furthermore, with a social and political system that appears hostile to notions of healthy sexual attitudes,  human sexuality, and reproduction, we have some clarity as to why there is a problem.

Understanding the problem may require looking at whether people talk to their parents about sex and reproductive health. Parents and guardians tend to be significant sources of information regarding such social issues. And while the internet rules our lives, parents are likely not the first source and even not the most in-depth source of information. However, they do play an outsized role in forming our broader perspectives and reinforcing cultural norms. I assume the same applies to issues such as sexual health.

The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) is one source of information about people speaking with their parents about reproductive health-related topics. The NSFG is a nationally representative survey that "*gathers information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men’s and women’s health.*" It is one of several large data sources the Department of Health and Human Services draws on to inform broad policy decisions. 

The survey contains an item in which respondents 25 years and under are asked whether they have ever discussed specific sex and birth control topics with their parents or guardians. I thought it would be a great idea to isolate that particular piece of data and create a small visualization that allows people to stratify the data using some key demographic characteristics (e.g., age, level of education, race, ethnicity, etc.).

I created the visual document in Tableau after using R to subset and clean the raw data downloaded from the NSFG website, operated by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a Center for Disease Control and Prevention division.

## Welcome one and all!

Hello everyone,

Welcome to my small website. I am research faculty at [Florida State University, College of Medicine](https://med.fsu.edu/). I work within the [Center for Translational Behavioral Science (CTBScience)](https://ctbs.fsu.edu/). My academic background is in public health, specifically health policy and management. My current work focuses on implementing and sustaining interventions in clinical care settings focused on American youth at risk for HIV. The ongoing career journey is great so far!

## Full Academic Profile

You may also access my other academic work via the below links. In recent years, there have been efforts to create social media networks for academics to connect and network with each other. The jury is still out on which of the numerous indexing and profiling sites are the best. Still, I provide links to some of the more popular ones, so click away and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.

**Google Scholar**

This is a freely accessible web search engine that indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature across an array of publishing formats and disciplines. In recent years, individual researchers have been able to create Scholar Citations profiles. You may access my profile below.

It was the first time I had flown since the pandemic burst onto the scene.[^1],[^2] Some [fun facts](https://www.niagarafallsusa.com/planning-tools/about-niagara-falls/fun-facts/) about the Falls.

Just wow. This morning, Hunga Tonga-Hunga Haʻapai, a volcano in the Pacific not too far from the island nation of Tonga, erupted violently. The subsequent destabilization and shockwaves have resulted in tsunami warnings issued for parts of the Pacific and much of the US west coastline[^1].

However, the marvels of modern technology mean we have a front-row seat to some of this magnificent though incredibly devastating natural occurrence. The Himawari 8, a Japanese weather satellite orbiting nearly 37 thousand kilometers, captured the explosion (see tweet below).

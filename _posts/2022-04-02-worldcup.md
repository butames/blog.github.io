The group draws for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar have been held, and Ghana has found itself in Group H. It is a tough group, and to be honest; I don't hold much for our chances. Our performances during the qualifiers and the recently ended African Cup of Nations, coupled with the Ghana Football Association's shedding of multiple managers, will likely impair our performance. C.K. Akonor helmed the team until late 2021, then along came Milovan Rajevac, whom we dismissed after our abysmal showing at AFCON 2022, and now we have Otto Addo as the steersman. 

Frankly, I don't see us being able to clamber out of Group H. We would have to overcome a robust Portugal and their ever-youthful talisman, Christiano Ronaldo. There will also be the fleet-footed Korean Republic. They always seem to have extra energy when it comes to these international competitions. And then there will be Uruguay with several hardened veterans looking to make their mark. 
As I said, I am not placing much hope for our chances. But, if we can beat Uruguay and prevent them from moving to the next tournament stage, I'll sleep comfortably.

Like many Ghanaians, I remember that Quarter-Final match-up in 2010 when we lost 4-2 via a penalty shootout. What grinds many gears is not the penalty shootout but the lead-up. In the waning minutes of regular time, Ghana's everlasting striker, Asamoah Gyan, seemingly bungled the ball into the back of the Uruguayan net as many Ghanaians looked on with breathless wonder at a possible miracle goal at the hands of Luis Suarez. A ball that seemed destined for the back of the Uruguayan net was slapped out, shattering millions of hearts. 
Adding salt to this wound was what happened next. As Ghanaians everywhere paused in their lives, Asamoah Gyan failed to convert the spot-kick awarded to Ghana for the egregious foul by Uruguay. It was tragic; for one moment, it felt as if the entire country had been doused with cold water. We then proceeded to lose the match via a penalty shootout. Even though Ghana had several opportunities to beat Uruguay after that incident, and we failed to capitalize on it, the image of Suarez's action still sticks in our collective craw. 

I remember where I was that day. I had spent an hours-long bus ride, bouncing along a dirt road that connected the outskirts of Damango to the sleepy hamlet of Larabanga to visit the Mole National Park. I wanted to see some Elephants. It had been a long sweaty day, and my tailbone was unhappy. We had finally arrived at the resort hotel in the park, and I was craving food, a hot shower/bath, and a warm bed. After check-in, I was heading to my chalet when I noticed some people crowded around a small TV blaring the match. I joined them only to watch Suarez handle the ball and Gyan miss what would have been a redeeming penalty. I then watched the remainder of the match, some 10 minutes of regular time, two extra-time periods, and the final penalty shootout. It was tragic. In a way, the exhaustion from the bus trip was a godsend because the disappointment would have kept me from sleeping.

The following day, the entire resort was abuzz with the defeat; even the foreign tourists who had no skin in the game grumbled their disappointment. It was such a profound moment. Two world cups on, that match still lives with me. So, when Ghana encounters Uruguay in Qatar, it is on sight! No quarter will be given (at least, I hope so).  

By the way if you ever find yourself in northern Ghana, I encoruage you to visite to visit the mosque at Larebanga, West Gonja, Ghana. It predates, portuguese maping a sea route to India along the coast of Africa.

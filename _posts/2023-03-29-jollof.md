So, I got access to Bard, Alphabet's (i.e., Google's) artificial intelligence bot. And decided to ask it a truly important question.

I don't know about the answer though, Bard's refusal to acknowledge Ghana's surpriority when it comes to Jollof rice seems to be just asking for trouble. Bard took a very middle of the road approach and this is absolutely incorrect (I am joking of course).

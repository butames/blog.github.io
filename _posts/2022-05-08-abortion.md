Came across this Andy Singer editorial cartoon today. I think it is a bit dated, but still, in this world of the recent SCOTUS, it is an interesting what-if exercise. 

I don't recall my Bible stories well. Still, I remember something about one of the gods in Genesis getting upset with Onan (one of the sons of Judah). Onan refused to ejaculate into his dead brother's wife (i.e., Er's wife, Er who had been previously killed by the same god because he was "wicked"); instead choosing to spill his seed on the ground. 

> ...And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar. And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him. And Judah said unto Onan, “Go in unto thy brother’s wife and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.” And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother. And the thing which he did displeased the Lord; therefore He slew him also.

-- Genesis 38, 6:10 (21st Century King James Version)


When I was growing up, the story was used to establish the notion that masturbation was a sin, including another classic Bible verse, like the one below.

>  Flee fornication. Every other sin which a man doeth is outside the body, but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.

-- 1 Corinthians 6:18 (21st Century King James Version)

In my youth, both were presented without any kind of anthropological context. Anyway, I read somewhere once that the story of Onan formed the basis for theological understandings of where life began. Perhaps if that philosophy remained prominent among Christian evangelicals, we would not be here. OF course, it would bring a whole set of other societal problems, I am sure.

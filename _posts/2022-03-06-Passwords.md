Who amongst us has not been in this situation? This very morning, I struggled to remember a password; after several attempts, I clicked on the “forgot password” button and received a link to reset the password. I went to the link address, and surprise, surprise, “Your new password cannot be the same as your old password.” If I had hair, I would pull it out in frustration.

I was listening to a radio station based on the music of Guru (the late jazz and hip-hop MC), and a song came on that I'd not heard in ages, *3 Tha Hard Way*. What a  hot cypher! Three talented MCs spitting the smoothest of rhymes over a dope beat. Because men so dominate hip-hop, I think culturally, we (or perhaps I) forget about the talented women who have blazed their trails in the industry. Bahamadia, K-Swift, and Mecca Starr, your song is still a masterpiece nearly thirty years on.

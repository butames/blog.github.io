excerpt: The best looking Santa I saw this holiday season.

Tiktok always produces some great memetic trends. A favorite of mine is the Infinity Challenge. It starts with the subject holding an unlit ring light (or LED light) behind them while dressed down or in everyday clothes. Then they raise the light over their heads, and in a quick camera change, all other lights in the room go out while the ring light provides the only illumination. Simultaneously, they've changed into something spectacular, or they've done up their make-up to look stunning, or they've oiled up their muscles, so they look buff. All while the chorus to Jaymes Young's **Infinity** blares in the background. It's an entertaining trend, and I think it's meant to show a glow-up. It reminds me of another trend that was a bit raunchier, The Silhouette Challenge.

The above from [@santaforacause](https://www.instagram.com/santaforacause/?hl=en) on Instagram is perhaps my favorite. The Santa Clause actor switches from his everyday habits to his official Kris Kringle uniform. But it's not just the change of outfit; it's the cherubic smile and the rosy cheeks that complete the get-up. The final product reminds me of the image of the Santa Claus used in Coca-Cola ads some years back (see below).

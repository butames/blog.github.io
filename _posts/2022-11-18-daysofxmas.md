As the holidays draw closer, I am listening more and more to holiday music, specifically the Christmas carol types. The other day, **The Twelve Days of Christmas** came on randomly, and I was reminded of Eddie Izzard's bit about everyone coming out to sing about "*Five gold rings*." The **Twelve Days of Christmas** can get repetitive as you go through it. It's the nature of cumulative songs. However, the part about five gold rings never fails to snap me back into the song's rhythm.

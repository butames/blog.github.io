Images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) show Jupiter in such a beautiful light. I have seen pictures of Jupiter before, and you get a sense of the size and scope of this planetary behemoth. But, it always seemed dull, muted, a lumbering giant. But these new pics from the JWST, my god, it so vibrant. Of course, it's an aggressively hostile environment to human life and existence, but still, it's gorgeous, like looking on an icy tundra after a blizzard.

The second picture below is labeled showing Jupiter's rings (the planet has four rings), some of its Moons, and the diffraction effect of Io (the third largest Galilean moon by mass).

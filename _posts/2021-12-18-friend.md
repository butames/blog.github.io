## Who do you call a friend

The other day, Joe Scarborough, conservative television presenter for MSNBC, tweeted the below picture of a poll conducted by Axios. 

Scarborough added, 
> "My most fascinating friendships have always come from "the other side. In Congress, I was considered one of the most conservative members but I always sat with Democrats and built friendships with John Lewis, Elijah Cummings, Ron Dellums, and Maxine Waters. I always benefited."
